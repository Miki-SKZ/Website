  The Beatles had a short run of only 10 years from 1960 to 1970, but they're still the best-selling artists of all time by far. If you were to add in their solo albums and side groups, they'll hold that record forever. They started young and led the British Invasion of pop and rock into the USA, and their fans grew up alongside them, purchasing each album as time went on.<br>
<br>
These guys won all the awards, starred in and produced movies, and even hold records like having the most covered song of all time. The Lennon-McCartney songwriting team is the most successful ever. They had pop appeal, and rock appeal, and evolved through the interests of the hippy era... they're some of the best musicians to ever exist. They're so good that hipsters think it's cool to hate them.<br>
<br>
Trivia Facts: UNESCO recognizes January the 16th as World Beatles Day. Eric Clapton was almost welcomed as the fifth Beatle. Each member of the band and the band itself have an asteroid named after them. Paul McCartney is still releasing music and getting millions of views on YouTube!<br>

  The Rolling Stones are such a big deal that even the members' solo careers, like that of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, are just as big. They got started in 1962 and were ar the forefront of the British Invasion. Of the top 5 highest-grossing tours, four of them belong to this band<br>
<br>
  Part of their success is attributed to them staying true to the safe foundational genres like R n' B, soul, and rock. They even recebtly won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blue Anthem. Consistency is key when pop music evolves and changes so rapidlym which is why they're still on top after nearky 60 years.<br>
  <br>
  Trivia Facts: The Rolling Stones thankfully survived the feuds that have broken up other bands. In that time they've released 30 studio albums, 23 live albums, 25 compilations, 120 singles, and embarked on 48 tours<br>

  Even with their early release led by Syd Varret, Pink Floyd was already making their mark on the British rock scene. Later, when David Gilmour joined the band and took over the creative direction they gained international recognition. Four of their albums topped the US and UK charts, though only two of their single ever reached top 10 in either region<br>
  
  In  a six-decade career, they've released 15 albyms and toured to support each release. They even composed film scores for some less-known movies. Two of their albums, The wall and The Dark Side of the Moon are both in the list of the best-selling albums of all time. Dark music like theirs won't even be considered a pop, but they have just as many fans as longer lasting popularity.<br>
  
  Trivia Facts: Pink Floyd's band name is derived from two of Syd Barret's favorite blues musicians. Pink Anderson and Floyd Council. They were hug fans of the comedy group Monty Python and hlped finance the 1975 movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail<br>
